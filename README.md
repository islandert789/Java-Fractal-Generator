# Java-Fractal-Generator
Generate fractal based on:
  base pattern: an array of turns in degrees that form a line.
    eg: [90] is a single turn, looks like (L).
  iteration number: integer value, 0 is initial pattern, 17 is the highest I have ever used
  mirrored: boolean
    true -> pattern is mirrored, good for patterns with turns in one direction like [90,90]
    false -> pattern isn't mirrored
    try out both to make cool patterns
 
 How to use:
  open Main.java
